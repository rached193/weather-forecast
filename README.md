## Post-Processing CSS
Create React App minifies your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to it automatically through Autoprefixer so you donâ€™t need to worry about it.

Support for new CSS features like the all property, break properties, custom properties, and media query ranges are automatically polyfilled to add support for older browsers.

You can customize your target support browsers by adjusting the browserslist key in package.json according to the Browserslist specification.
